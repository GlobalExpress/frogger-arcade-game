HTML frogger game

Description:
Very basic 2D game where the goal is to reach the water without bumping into the bugs. 

Files and Folders:
  index.html
  README.md
  css folder 
  images folder
  js folder (3 important files exist here, the engine.js resources.js and app.js)
  
How to run and play the game:
Once the files and folders are downloaded, double click the index.html file. You will be presented with a welcome screen and character selection option. 
Once you've selected your character click the launch button to run the game. 
Using the arrow keys on your keyboard navigate your Hero towards the water and avoid hitting the bugs. Once you reach the water, a point will be given. A score will be displayed. However, bumping into the bugs will reset your Heros position and deduct a point from your score. If the score reaches a negative value its game over.
