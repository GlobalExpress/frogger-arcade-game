HTML frogger game

Very basic 2D game where the goal is to reach the water without bumping into the bugs. When loading the HTML file, the user will
be able to select a character. If no character is selected a default character is loaded. 
A point score is also shown. If the user goes below 0 (i.e negative points) the game will end with a game over message.
