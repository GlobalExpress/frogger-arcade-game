		<p>Good day welcome to a basic HTML5 game called Frogger. </br> The game is very simple. Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, navigate your character towards the water. Avoid hitting the bugs. If you come too close, your character will reposition to its starting position. Once you reach the water your goal is complete. You will accumulate score. Be careful, if you keep hitting the bugs score will be deducted. If the score goes below 0, its GAME OVER! Very simple indeed, but enjoy!</p>
